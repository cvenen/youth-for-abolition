            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Abolition is the eradication of the prison-industrial complex 
                and other structures of violence that disproportionately target
                people of color. Abolition seeks to create a new world through 
                restorative and transformative justice practices.

            <p style="font-size:18px;"> 
                <em>Why abolition? The system isn't broken!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>The current structure of society maintains systemic issues, such as racism and sexism, 
                that marginalize certain groups of people and uphold white, patriarchal values. 
                Due to the inherent structures of institutions, they must be eradicated and new 
                systems must be built. The system is not broken because that implies that it had at one point worked 
                the system has never worked and therefore must end.

                <em>How to get involved?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>Abolitionists do not have uniform ideas on how to eradicate the current system. 
                They focus their energy on efforts that they believe are most effective or address a 
                specific aspect of society. For example, the NIA works to end the incarceration of 
                children and young adults.
