                    margin: 20px; width: 50%; height: auto;">
                    <p>From the 16th to 19th century, the transatlantic slave trade boomed. 
                        Countries and colonies in Western Europe and America enslaved around 12 
                        million Africans. Slavery was used to increase the profits of domestic and 
                        international enterprises.</p>
                    <p>Then, in late 18th century, Quakers and other groups criticized 
                        slavery for violating the rights of man. Eventually in 1838, the British West Indies 
                        abolished slavery, however the United States was not persuaded as easily.</p> 
                    <p>Abolitionists in the US, such as William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, 
                        and Lydia Maria Child, held various views on abolition and methods to accomplish 
                        abolition. While the general public initially disliked the extremism of abolition, 
                        it garnered more support when the US expanded West.</p> 
                    <p>During this time, the Fugitive Slave Law and the inhumane actions of slave hunters 
                        generated opposition to slavery. Nevertheless, economic interests also influenced people's 
                        support for or against slavery.</p> 
                    <p>Northerners, such as Abraham Lincoln, opposed slavery whereas Southerners supported it. 
                        Thus, Lincoln's election in 1861 fueled the American Civil War. As a result, the Emancipation 
                        Proclamation in 1863 freed the slaves and the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 abolished slavery.</p>

                <h2>Racial Capitalism, Punishment, and Prisons</h2>

                    margin:20px; width: 50%; height: auto;">
                    <p>Prior to the formation of the United States, colonialism enforced ideas of white superiority 
                        and patriarchy that distinguished white men from black people, immigrants, women, and laborers. 
                        These values continued into the formation of the US and founded its capitalist economy on punishment 
                        and racial capitalism.</p>
                    <p>White privilege with Black oppression increased the country’s wealth and 
                        maintained the colonial forms of marginalization. Even after slavery was outlawed, new policies 
                        did not protect Black people from forms of punishment and control.</p> 
                    <p>Incarceration and the expansion of prisons began as a new way to enslave Black Americans. As a result, Blackness was criminalized 
                        and associated with deviance. These portrayals of Black of Americans continue to this day with the 
                        effects of the War on Drugs, mass incarceration, and the exploitation of prison labor.</p> 
                    <p>Furthermore, the Prison Industrial Complex perpetuates this cycle of punishment and control in exchange for profit. 
                        The expansion of private prisons and the use of free prison labor has allowed many private companies 
                        to increase their revenues.</p>
                    <p>Although the US economy is framed as a free market economy, it ignores the 
                        systemic issues of racism that enforces white privilege and white capital accumulation. Moreover, a 
                        color-blind society is harmful because it disallows equitable means for people to gain wealth.</p>
                    <p>While past abolitionist movements have succeeded in abolishing slavery, lynching, and segregation, 
                        new forms of oppression have replaced them. As long as racial capitalism exists, prison abolition 
                        is unachievable as the two systems rely on each other. People of color are still being exploited 
                        under forms of punishment that maintain power for white, patriarchal groups.</p>

                <h2>Love: A Political Tool for Abolition</h2>

                    <img src="imgs/Abolish_ICE.jpg" alt="sign saying to abolish ICE" style="float:right;
                    margin:20px; width: 45%; height: auto;">
                    <p>Abolition seeks to create a new world with equitable access to basic necessities. A tool to transform this 
                        current society is love. Love has the transformative powers to create a new subject.</p>
                    <p>Since colonial times, the social construction of whiteness has hinged on the existence of Blackness. 
                        Whiteness– being white –is desirable because it entails power and privilege which is in contrast to Blackness. 
                        Blackness is undesirable because it is associated with deviance and inferiority.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that the negative construction of Blackness still exists seen through media depictions of criminal Black men. 
                        While these ideas of whiteness and Blackness exist, systems of oppression will persist.</p>
                    <p>However, love is a tool that can be used to overcome and destroy these constructions. Love as a political tool means 
                        to love someone regardless of their differences from oneself and also loving them for said differences.</p>
                    <p>If people love others who are far removed from their own lives, then a new world will be created 
                        in which everyone is accounted for and cared for. This transformative power in love is what some abolitionists believe 
                        is essential for there to be true change.</p>
