            <h2>Brief History of Abolition</h2>
            <p>
                From the 16th to 19th century, the transatlantic slave trade boomed. 
                Countries and colonies in Western Europe and America enslaved around 12 
                million Africans. Slavery was used to increase the profits of domestic and 
                international enterprises. However, in the late 18th century, the Quakers 
                and other religious or non-religious groups criticized slavery for violating 
                the rights of man. In 1838, the British West Indies abolished slavery but the 
                United States faced greater difficulty. The abolitionists in the US, such as 
                William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Lydia Maria Child, held various 
                views on abolition and methods to accomplish abolition. While the general public 
                initially disliked the extremism of abolition, it garnered more support as the 
                United States expanded West. During this time, the Fugitive Slave Law and the 
                inhumane actions of slave hunters generated dislike towards slavery. However, 
                economic interests moving West were also a role in society’s support for or against slavery. 
                The South supported slavery and therefore when Abraham Lincoln was elected as President in 1861, 
                the American Civil War began shortly after. As a result, the Emancipation Proclamation in 
                1863 freed the slaves and the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 abolished slavery.

                <h2>Racial Capitalism, Punishment, and Prisons</h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to the formation of the United States, colonialism enforced ideas of white superiority 
                    and patriarchy that distinguished white men from black people, immigrants, women, and laborers. 
                    These values continued into the formation of the US and founded its capitalist economy on punishment 
                    and racial capitalism. White privilege and Black oppression increased the country’s wealth and 
                    maintained the colonial forms of marginalization. Even after slavery was outlawed, the new policies 
                    did not protect Black people from forms of punishment and control. Incarceration and the expansion 
                    of prisons began as a new way to enslave Black Americans. As a result, Blackness was criminalized 
                    and associated with deviance. These portrayals of Black of Americans continue to this day with the 
                    effects of the War on Drugs, mass incarceration, and the exploitation of prison labor. 
                    <p>
                    Furthermore, the Prison Industrial Complex perpetuates this cycle of punishment and control in exchange for profit. 
                    The expansion of private prisons and the use of free prison labor has allowed many private companies 
                    to increase their revenues. Although the US economy is framed as a free market economy, it ignores the 
                    systemic issues of racism that enforces white privilege and white capital accumulation. Moreover, a 
                    color-blind society is harmful because it disallows equitable means for people to gain wealth. While past 
                    abolitionist movements have succeeded in abolishing slavery, lynching, and segregation, new forms of oppression 
                    have replaced them. As long as racial capitalism exists, prison abolition is unobtainable as the two systems 
                    rely on each other. People of color are still being exploited under forms of punishment that maintain power 
                    for white, patriarchal groups.

                <h2>Love: A Political Tool for Abolition</h2>
                <p>
                    Abolition seeks to create a new world of equitable access to basic necessities. A tool to transform this 
                    current society is love. Love has the transformative powers to create a new subject. Since colonial times, 
                    the social construction of whiteness has hinged on the existence of Blackness. Whiteness– being white –is 
                    desirable because it entails power and privilege which is in contrast to Blackness. Blackness is undesirable 
                    because it is associated with deviance and inferiority. It is evident that the negative construction of Blackness 
                    still exists through the media depictions of criminal Black men. While these ideas of whiteness and Blackness exist, 
                    systems of oppression will persist. However, love is a tool that can be used to overcome and destroy these constructions. 
                    Love as a political tool means to love someone regardless of their differences from oneself and also loving them for 
                    these differences. If people love others who are far removed from their own lives, then a new world will be created 
                    in which everyone is accounted for and cared for. This transformative power in love is what some abolitionists believe 
                    is essential for there to be true change.
