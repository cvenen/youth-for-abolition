# youth-for-abolition

This project was built for my Final Project for SOC281-Criminology.

'about.html', 'get_involved.html', 'learn.html', and 'resources.html' are the code for the corresponding subpages. 'index.html' is the home page. 

The 'imgs' folder contains all images used for the site. Image sources are posted on the site.
